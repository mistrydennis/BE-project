# Oculus-Vision For Blind

We created a smart hat and written our object detection code using Caffe model on Raspberry Pi.
The file "object-detection.py" is a code which was written by me referring to PyImageSearch and my friends assisted me in bits and parts.

Oculus_Blackbook contains all the use case,swim lane and time modelling charts.
Oculus.png is the image of our end product.
